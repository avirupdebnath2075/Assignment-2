Logic: A number is even if it is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0).
Otherwise, it is odd.

Problem Description: This Python program uses a for loop to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 50.

Logic: Initialize a variable (sum = 0).
Loop from 1 to 50 and add each number to sum.
Display the final result.
